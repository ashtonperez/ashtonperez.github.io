By Liliana Bounegru, Lucy Chambers, and Jonathan Gray
https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/datajournalismcom/handbooks/The-Data-Journalism-Handbook-1.pdf

######Intro: 
This book covers what data journalism is, specifically, and what it is not. Top journalists give their opinions on its future and profound examples. Explaining in depth data processes and many ‘how to’s’ within the journalism job. The authors describe that if you have, “a nose for news and an ability to tell a compelling story, a new world of possibility opens up.”

######My interests: 
The title of the book caught my eye initially. Seeing ‘journalism’ and ‘data’ together was intriguing and curiosity got the better of me. As I read the intro, I discovered hundreds of people contributed to this book from all over the world. The vast experience the book holds is attractive to me. I deeply value diverse experiences and perspectives which align well with this book's theme. Another reason I decided to choose this book was the tone and style. It intentionally reads like a rich and purposeful conversation. I was easily able to read through pages and pages of the first chapter. It seems many fields have a little bit of data journalism in them. Data journalism helps tell complex stories to attract awareness on many social issues. A great example I came across was Hans Rosling’s infographic for world poverty using Gapminder. I thoroughly enjoyed the diagrams and visuals offered as a learning tool throughout the pages I read. I am an educator and appreciate when a product is made for all learning types.
