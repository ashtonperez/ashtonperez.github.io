## Massachusetts Public Schools Data
[MA Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data/code)

###### Intro:
This data set seeks to answer three main questions: 
1. What contributes to differences in school outcomes?
2. Are there meaningful regional differences within MA?
3. Which schools do well despite limited resources?

The data set includes the following fields: enrollment by grade, enrollment by selected population, enrollment by race/gender, class size by gender and selected populations, teacher salaries, per pupil expenditure, graduation rates, graduates attending higher education, advanced placement, SAT, accountability and reports.

By clicking on the code section users can see the different contributors and their specific research and conclusions. 

###### Possible Applications: 

The MA data was utilized to find what impacts student college rate. Using the provided data this contributor found that economic status is the largest indicator of college attendance and that Charter and pilot schools outperform public schools. To see the detailed preprocessing and visual transformations, please follow the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ndalziel/who-goes-to-college)

Another application the MA data performed was finding how funding levels, class size and teacher salaries impact school success outcomes. Using the provided data this contributor found all variables have an impact. Though many interesting variabilities occurred depending on school type.

A *potential* application that can be used on this data set is enhancing STEM interest in female students. The current data set consists of student demographics, class size, location, academic achievement, placement and enrollment. With this information we could find correlations and patterns for better recruitment, increased enthusiasm/interest, and retention for STEM fields within the female population. We can answer big questions such as, “is STEM interest between male and female students disproportionate? Are there equal opportunities in school? what societal/school norms and expectations create this imbalance? Why? How can we correct this?” By tracking their futures in STEM this could help make predictions for new generations. We could possibly do this for current data on STEM career women and work backward.







## *The Data Journalism Handbook 1*
**By Liliana Bounegru, Lucy Chambers, and Jonathan Gray**

[The Data Journalism Handbook 1](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/datajournalismcom/handbooks/The-Data-Journalism-Handbook-1.pdf) 

###### Intro: 
This book covers what data journalism is, specifically, and what it is not. Top journalists give their opinions on its future and profound examples. Explaining in depth data processes and many ‘how to’s’ within the journalism job. The authors describe that if you have, “a nose for news and an ability to tell a compelling story, a new world of possibility opens up.”

###### My interests: 
The title of the book caught my eye initially. Seeing ‘journalism’ and ‘data’ together was intriguing and curiosity got the better of me. As I read the intro, I discovered hundreds of people contributed to this book from all over the world. The vast experience the book holds is attractive to me. I deeply value diverse experiences and perspectives which align well with this book's theme. Another reason I decided to choose this book was the tone and style. It intentionally reads like a rich and purposeful conversation. I was easily able to read through pages and pages of the first chapter. It seems many fields have a little bit of data journalism in them. Data journalism helps tell complex stories to attract awareness on many social issues. A great example I came across was Hans Rosling’s infographic for world poverty using Gapminder. I thoroughly enjoyed the diagrams and visuals offered as a learning tool throughout the pages I read. I am an educator and appreciate when a product is made for all learning types. I believe data journalism is a valuable skill to have. Being able to covey meaning and a story to your data to others is just as important in being a data scientists as collecting, processing and analyzing data. I look forward to learning more.
